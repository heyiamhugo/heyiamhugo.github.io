<h3>Poster for Tomorrow 2022</h3>
<div class="projecttext">

<p>Poster for Tomorrow is an international poster competition, serving as the flagship project of 4tomorrow, an independent non-profit organization based in Paris. The competition's primary objective is to inspire individuals, both within and outside the design community, to create thought-provoking posters that foster dialogue on issues of global relevance. With a history spanning over a decade, Poster for Tomorrow has attracted over 40,000 submissions from more than 150 countries and organized over 1,000 exhibitions across five continents.</p>
<p>The competition's 2022 theme, "Do the right thing," marked a return to its foundational principles. This broad theme presented a multitude of challenges in effectively communicating its essence. Motivated by my personal outrage towards the devastating war in Ukraine, I took it upon myself to contribute three distinct solutions for the competition's briefing. While two of my posters were presented as a cohesive collection, the remaining pieces were showcased individually, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of the theme's complexities.</p>
<p>Central to my work was the overarching message that the concepts of war and peace have assumed an unprecedented level of importance in contemporary society. In light of this, I employed distinctive symbols in each poster, each representing the core idea of the elusive "missing peace." By visually communicating the urgency and significance of war and peace, my intention was to encourage viewers to contemplate the profound impact these concepts hold on our world today.</p>
