<h3>About me</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Hugo, and I am a graphic designer from Portugal. I developed a passion for design at a very young age,
as my father worked in some of the largest print shops in the
country. During my college years, I had the opportunity to
work on various projects, and I was recognized by my peers 
and teachers for my commitment and eagerness to learn.
<p>In addition to my love for design, I have always been involved
    in volunteering and activism since a very young age. As such, 
    I frequently embark on personal projects that are related to 
    these fields. This allows me to merge my passion for design
    with my commitment to making a positive impact on society.</p>
<p>As a graphic designer, I believe that design can be used to
    convey powerful messages and evoke emotions. My goal is to
    seek new challenges and opportunities to grow as a designer
    and as a person.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, and I 
    look forward to potentially collaborating with you in the
    future!</p>

<h3>Milestones & Updates</h3>

 <div class="milestones">
  <div class="milestones1">
   <h4>Now You See Me Moria Exhibition</h4>
<p>In 2021, I participated in the Now You See Me Moria call to action as a designer, creating posters showcasing the dire conditions of the Moria Camp. Today, I feel proud to be part of the international exhibition at Porto's Aliados and Marquês Metro stations. During the event, I emphasized the project's impact and our strong connection between design and activism at Lusófona University of Porto. I concluded by highlighting that Design without people is like an empty museum; as designers, we must collaborate to address global issues. Notable participants included Noemi, Carla Cadete, Marco Ferreira, and Raul Manarte.</p>

<h4>Tate Museum in Porto</h4>
<p>I'm thrilled to have contributed to a remarkable motion graphics workshop that united three Portuguese universities.
