<h3>BigHand Campaign</h3>
<div class="projecttext">

<p>The Big Hand is a non-governmental organization for development that promotes the well-being of children living in unfavorable conditions, with special attention to orphan girls. It ensures their access to education, healthcare, nutrition, water, and basic sanitation. Every year, they run a special fund-raising campaign called "1 lápis por uma escola," which translates to "A pencil for a school" in English. This campaign is extremely important as it directly contributes to helping The Big Hand build and repair infrastructure in remote villages, particularly in places like Mozambique.</p>
<p>For this campaign, we had to design several elements for different supports, so the identity had to be versatile and easy to replicate. With this in mind, we created an illustration using our own hands to help us represent the power each of us has to change this situation. The final result is one that works extremely well across a multitude of different applications and helps The Big Hand extend the reach of their message.</p>
<p>The "1 lápis por uma escola" campaign has a profound impact on The Big Hand's ability to improve the lives of children in disadvantaged circumstances. By mobilizing resources and raising funds, The Big Hand can make a significant difference in building and repairing infrastructure in remote villages, ensuring access to education, healthcare, and other essential services. The campaign's versatility and powerful message resonate with individuals from various backgrounds, allowing them to contribute to positive change. Through collective effort, we can create a better future for children in need and help them overcome the challenges they face.</p>
