<h3>Now You See Me Moria</h3>
<div class="projecttext">

<p>In 2021, I was one of several designers who saw the Now You See Me Moria call to action to design posters with images depicting the terrible conditions of the Moria Camp. Moved by this, I invited all of my classmates to participate, and it was received quite well! This even allowed us to have a special part of the project in which we designed posters to share the dreams of the children of Moria.</p>
<p>Additionally, I also participated in their other call to action, "Now or Never," which aimed to design and spread posters related to the Afghan community. Both of these projects were spread throughout the world in several galleries, universities, etc. Recently, I am proud to have been a part of the international conference panel for the exhibition of this project at the Aliados and Marquês Metro stations in Porto, Portugal.</p>
<p>I took the opportunity to talk about the impact of the project and how we, at Lusófona University of Porto, have a truly beautiful relationship with design and activism. My final message was that design without people is like an empty museum - we need to come together as designers to help change the world's problems. As designers, we must work with people. Joining me were Noemi, Carla Cadete, Marco Ferreira, and Raul Manarte.</p>
